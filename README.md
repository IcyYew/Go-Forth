## Tech Conquest - Not being worked on


## Description
Tech Conquest was a project worked on by myself(Michael Geltz), Nicholas Lynch, Joshua Dwight, and Ryan Johnson for our Software Development Practices course during Spring 2024. Nicholas and Joshua worked on the frontend development while Ryan and I worked on the backend. My role outside of writing the code for the backend was to maintain the database and ensure our server was working as intended. 

## Skills Developed
Scrum Framework Practices

Drafting diagrams to display the interconnectivity of our entire project -- Frontend to backend communication, how our backend internally manages information to send and recieve from the frontend and then relays that information to our   
database (Image provided below)

Collaborating on a project with separate internal teams

Managing expectations for team member contribution

Learning git workflow

Creating and managing database schemas

Testing for failure cases in our program

Solving failure cases

Writing good coverage tests to ensure proper functionality

Managing a provided server -- setting up pipelines for git, updating application versions, parsing error messages to find issues

Composing JSON payloads to be easily parsable by the frontend, and vice-versa

Writing good compartmentalized code to keep things manageable and to make fixing potential issues easier

Understanding the differences between protocols, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH

Utilizing websockets for player-to-player chatting and for updating the map simulataneously

Utilizing Maven for package version control & acquisition

Many more...

## Installation
!! Unfortunately, as is, this game cannot be run as the server provided to us is no longer running. I could retrofit the whole thing to operate on a different server but I don't have the time as of now.
